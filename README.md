# A stopwatch made in Rust

This is just a quick project to grasp the basics of Rust. I'm using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) for the GUI and [rust-stopwatch](https://github.com/ellisonch/rust-stopwatch) for the stopwatch (and I totally didn't steal the name... I would never...).

Features

-   Start
-   Stop
-   Clear
-   Lap

How to use

First, run the program. Second, click the `start` button. There you go! A stopwatch started.
